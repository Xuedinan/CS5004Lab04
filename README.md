### Writing assignment

:star:  **Weekly report**

By completing Lab Assignment 04, I'm familiar with LinkedList and practice a lot of implementation. In addition, since this is an open design assignment, I also try to add more OOD design principles to my assignment, like using more ENUM, Interface, Abstract Class, extracting generic function to a tool class, making my program more abstract and friendly to extension in the future, etc.

For the Linked List data structure, I think it's really great for the design that needs a dynamic size of data structure and is easy to insert and delete. Like this assignment, by using Linked List, we could quickly access the head of all tasks and help us with quick updating and modification, and it saved more memory by utilizing the non-continuous memory of the computer. However, I think this assignment is also achievable without using Linked List, we could implement an array or tree structure but might have different time and space complexity based on our operation design of this program.

In my program, I also apply extension as;
1.
2.
3.
